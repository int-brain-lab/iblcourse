    "# Topic of the course\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical course, you will explore the behavior of expert mice doing the IBL task. Mice perform the task one time a day, and we call this a behavioral training *session*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore together some responses of the mice, and then you will select one of these projects:\n",
    "- Do male mice respond faster than female mice?\n",
    "- Does training at late time in the day impact on performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction: What data will be used\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use three [pandas dataframes](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html):\n",
    "- `df_subjects` that contains the information on the mouse, which we call subject, for example its name, its date of birth\n",
    "- `df_sessions` that contains the information on the behavioral sessions made by each subject, for example the start time of the session, or the task protocol used\n",
    "- `df_trials` that contains the information for each trials of the sessions, for example the time of the go cue.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dataframe will contain the information of over 300+ sessions, for over 100+ mice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download the datasets\n",
