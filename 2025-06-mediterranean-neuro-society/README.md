# MNS 2025 Workshop on open-source tools for behavioral quantification

Workshop website: https://mns2025.org/workshop-on-open-source-tools-for-behavioral-quantification/

The ability to precisely quantify animal movements from video data is fundamental to advancing a wide range of scientific and biomedical applications. Recent advances in machine learning have led to an explosion of algorithms for analyzing behavior, but effectively using these tools requires user-friendly software that supports robust, scalable, and reproducible data analysis. In this workshop, participants will learn how to build a behavioral quantification pipeline from scratch using two complementary tools: Lightning Pose for pose estimation and Variational Animal Motion Encoding (VAME) for unsupervised behavioral segmentation. Lightning Pose reduces video data into a time series of poses, defined by user-selected keypoints per frame, while VAME extracts repeated behavioral motifs from these pose estimation outputs. Using intuitive user interfaces, participants will learn how to set up projects, process their video data, and analyze behavioral outputs without requiring advanced programming skills. Together, these tools form a powerful, integrated pipeline for state-of-the-art behavioral video analysis, fostering reproducibility, best practices, and new opportunities for scientific discovery across disciplines.
